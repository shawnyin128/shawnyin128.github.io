On our first night in Fairbanks, we were blessed with the mesmerizing sight of the Aurora Borealis. As the sun lingered on the horizon in its slow descent, two faint ribbons of aurora stretched across the sky. The initial excitement of witnessing this natural phenomenon reached its peak when the aurora suddenly burst into a spectacular display, painting the entire sky with its ethereal dance.

Our journey then took us to Denali National Park, a destination I had dreamed of visiting. Although our tight schedule didn't allow us to see the majestic Denali mountain itself, the park's wild beauty left an indelible impression on us.

One of the most extraordinary experiences of our trip was exploring glaciers and ice caves. We embarked on both an ice cave exploration and a helicopter tour to view these ancient ice formations from different perspectives. The mesmerizing blue ice cave with its ethereal formations left us in awe, while taking a small sip of pristine glacier water made every exhausting moment of the journey worthwhile - a pure, refreshing taste that reminded us of nature's untouched wonders.

We are grateful to the car rental staff who recommended Seward to us. Setting out from Anchorage, we witnessed the slowly setting sun casting its golden light across the bay and mountains. The journey was absolutely worth it.

On our final day, we visited Whittier, known to Chinese travelers as "the world's loneliest town." This remote settlement, nestled between mountains and sea, holds a unique charm of its own. We were fortunate enough to capture the stunning starry sky on our return journey, a perfect finale to our Alaskan adventure.
